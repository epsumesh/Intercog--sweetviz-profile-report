# Intercog--sweetviz-profile-report
This code is useful for beginners who wants to generate a quick analysis of excel sheet data. 
The data file "data.xlsx"can be downloaded and saved to your computer or you may use your own data files with appropriate change in variables in the code.
The data is taken from Kaggle data set "https://www.kaggle.com/arslanali4343/real-estate-dataset" with a random country location added as first row to make the data dependency with respect to a catgorical name to resemble it to a normal data set most people will be working with.
